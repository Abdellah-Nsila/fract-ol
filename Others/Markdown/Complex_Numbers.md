# Complex numbers

 - So lets look to power of a number: pow(4) = 16, pow(2) = 4, pow(-2) = 4, pow(-1) = 1
 - Cool but lets try the sqrt of a number: sqrt(16) = 4, sqrt(4) = 2, sqrt(-1) Ok thats intersting the sqrt of an negative number is not existing because the power of a negative number is always a positive number.
 - So can you imagine a value of sqrt(-1)? because you can imagine let's called `i` (imaginary number) thats it, now we have create a new type of numbers the imaginary numbers it's also include all real numbers in his domaine; so now we consider `sqrt(-1) = i` and also `i^2 = -1`.
 - Now imagie an axe (line), the middle of this axe we have `0`, right of this axe we have all positive numbers, on left we have all negative numbers, yes this is the x-axis, its containe only the real numbers (5, 0, -15, 1/3 2.78, sqrt(2), ...).
 - But what about imaginary numbers? in simple term this is the y-axis, but insted of having numbers like this (-5, 0, 1, 66), we have like this (-5i, 0i, 1i, 66i) if you have a good imagination skills you know that we have a `2D plan`.
 - An imaginary number is a combinision between two part an real part (x-axis) and imaginary part (y-axis); Complex number notation: `x + yi` which `x` is the real cmponent, and `yi` is the imaginary component, in docs you see this format `a + bi` its same btw, and the Complex number describe a point in the 2D plan.
 - Finaly you must know that the complex number is a coordinate of an point in 2D plan wich useful to use in our programme so now we can implement a `Complex plan (2D plan)` in any graphique window and control pixels like a point in a 2D plan with his own complex number (coordinate).

# Complex Plan

 - Basicaly is the 2D plan XD, x-axis and y-axis
 - Which the x-axis represent the real numbers, and the y-axis represent the imaginary numbers
